## Setup

This project is setup to use [editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/). Most editors work but some require a plugin like [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)

It's advisable to create a virtual environment for this project to keep packages separate.
> **__NOTE__:** Using pyenv, you can run `pyenv virtualenv 3.10.<latest> celery-sqlalchemy-scheduler`

After creating a virtual environment, install the required dependencies.

```sh
just setup-dev
```

### Celery Configuration

The library makes use of the parent service's database and scope management mechanism.
You can configure sqlalchemy `session_scope` when you configure celery, for example as:

```Python
from celery import Celery

# this comes from parent service
from server.db import session_scope

celery = Celery('tasks')

celery.conf.update(
    {'session_scope': session_scope}
)
```

## Development

The periodic tasks still need 'workers' to execute them. So make sure
the default **Celery** package is installed. (If not installed, please
follow the installation instructions here:
<https://github.com/celery/celery>)

Both the worker and beat services need to be running at the same time.

1.  Start a Celery worker service (specify your project name):

        $ celery -A [project-name] worker --loglevel=info

2.  As a separate process, start the beat service (specify the
    scheduler):

        $ celery -A [project-name] beat -l info --scheduler uxi_celery_scheduler.schedulers:DatabaseScheduler

### Example creating crontab-based periodic task

A crontab schedule has the fields: `minute`, `hour`, `day_of_week`,
`day_of_month` and `month_of_year`, so if you want the equivalent of a
`30 * * * *` (execute every 30 minutes) crontab entry, you specify:

```Python
    >>> from uxi_celery_scheduler.controller import schedule_task
    >>> from uxi_celery_scheduler.data_models import ScheduledTask
    >>> scheduled_task = {
    ...             "name": "task_1",
    ...             "task": "echo",
    ...             "schedule": {
    ...                 "minute": "30",
    ...                 "hour": "*",
    ...                 "day_of_week": "*",
    ...                 "day_of_month": "*",
    ...                 "month_of_year": "*",
    ...                 "timezone": "UTC",
    ...             },
    ...         }
    >>> with session_scope() as session:
    ...      task = schedule_task(session, ScheduledTask.parse_obj(scheduled_task))
```

The crontab schedule is linked to a specific timezone using the
'timezone' input parameter.

## Version Control

This repo follows the [SemVer 2](https://semver.org/) version format.

Given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, increment the:

- `MAJOR` version when you make incompatible API changes,
- `MINOR` version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
- `PATCH` version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.
